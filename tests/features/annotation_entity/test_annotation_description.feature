    Scenario: Add and delete annotation description to uploaded item - image item
        Given I upload an item in the path "0000000162.jpg" to the dataset
        And   I upload annotation in the path "0162_annotations.json" to the item
        When  I add description "Annotation description" to the annotation
        Then  I validate annotation.description has "Annotation description" value
        When  I remove description from the annotation
        Then  I validate annotation.description has "None" value
