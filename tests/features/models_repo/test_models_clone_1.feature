Feature: Models repository clone testing

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "model_mgmt"
    And I create a dataset with a random name
    And I upload an item by the name of "test_item.jpg"
    When I upload labels to dataset
    And I upload "5" box annotation to item

  @DAT-55187
  Scenario: test clone model
    Given I fetch the dpk from 'model_dpk/modelBasicDpk.json' file
    When I create a dummy model package by the name of "dummymodel" with entry point "main.py"
    And I create a model from package by the name of "test-model" with status "trained" in index "0"
    And I publish a dpk to the platform
    And I install the app
    And i fetch the model by the name "test-model"
    When i "deploy" the model
    Then model status should be "deployed" with execution "False" that has function "None"
    When i "evaluate" the model
    Then model status should be "deployed" with execution "True" that has function "evaluate_model"
    When i "evaluate" the model
    Then model status should be "deployed" with execution "True" that has function "evaluate_model"
    Then model metadata should include operation "evaluate" with filed "datasets" and length "1"
    When I clone a model
    Then model input should be equal "image", and output should be equal "box"
    Then model do not have operation "evaluate"
    And I clean the project

  Scenario: test clone model failed
    Given I fetch the dpk from 'model_dpk/modelBasicDpk.json' file
    When I create a dummy model package by the name of "dummymodel" with entry point "main.py"
    And I create a model from package by the name of "test-model" with status "failed" in index "0"
    And I publish a dpk to the platform
    And I install the app
    And i fetch the model by the name "test-model"
    When I clone the model
    Then model status should be "pre-trained"
    And I clean the project

  @DAT-77435
  Scenario: test clone model artifact
    Given I fetch the dpk from 'model_dpk/modelBasicDpk.json' file
    When I create a dummy model package by the name of "dummymodel" with entry point "main.py"
    And I create a model from package by the name of "test-model" with status "trained" in index "0"
    And I publish a dpk to the platform
    And I install the app
    And i fetch the model by the name "test-model"
    And I upload artifact in "0000000162.jpg"
    When I clone the model
    Then src model and clone model should have the same artifact name and different id
    And I clean the project
