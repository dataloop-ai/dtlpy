Feature: Items repository download service testing

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "items_download"
    And I create a dataset with a random name

    # Scenario: Download item by name - save locally
    #     Given There are no items
    #     And I upload an item by the name of "test_item.jpg"
    #     And Folder "test_items_download" is empty
    #     When I download an item by the name of "/test_item.jpg" to "test_items_download"
    #     Then There are "1" files in "test_items_download"
    #     And Item is correctly downloaded to "test_items_download/items/test_item.jpg" (compared with "0000000162.jpg")
