Feature: Annotaions repository List service testing

    Background: Initiate Platform Interface
        Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
        And I create a project by the name of "annotations_list"
        And I create a dataset with a random name
        When I add "free_text" attribute to ontology
            | key=1 | title=attr1 | scope=all |

    @testrail-C4523037
    @DAT-46431
    Scenario: List all annotations when no annotations exists
        Given Labels in file: "assets_split/annotations_crud/labels.json" are uploaded to test Dataset
        And Item in path "assets_split/annotations_crud/0000000162.jpg" is uploaded to "Dataset"
        And There are no annotations
        When I list all annotations
        Then I receive an empty annotations list
